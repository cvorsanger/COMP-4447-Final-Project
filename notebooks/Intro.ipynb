    "Every four years (five years sometimes) something special happens. No, it is not the world's greatest athletes coming together to showcase elite human athleticism in the Summer Olympics. Rather, it is the millions of people that come together to tweet about these athletes. In a showcase of exceptional human thumbs, these people tell you all you need to know about the Olympics; with 100% accuracy of course. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what does the twitter-sphere have to say about the Olympics? Are there sports that are being talked about in a better light than others? How does the sentiment of the Olympics change over the course of the event? In this project, we will be investigating tweet sentiment involving Olympic sports to see how they evolve. In the end, the sentiment of specific sports will be analyzed and any trends should be discovered.\n",

    "Text sentiment analysis is really nothing new. With the advancements of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques building a sentiment analysis tool has become commonplace in a wide variety of applications. While sentiment analysis is not limited to Twitter and can be used for any text data, with its vast amount of text data and the constant addition of data Twitter has been used in many sentiment analysis applications. From using Twitter data to help predict stock data as in [Anshul Mittal](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2011/GoelMittal-StockMarketPredictionUsingTwitterSentimentAnalysis.pdf) to the always civil discussions about politics as shown in the [Geeks for Geeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/) and [TSAM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6581022?casa_token=qrfkpDZP30sAAAAA:PNpsFf2_T9jXUB81SKLMldZji2tDprsCz4Ec4QSrHxlJQNIW3Yi52tWHZ4jhfTgPrqRjzjdKBfA). Unsurprisingly, there has been work done in the Olympic domain. The closest work we have discovered documented in a paper was in [2016 Olympic Games on Twitter: Sentiment Analysis of Sports Fans Tweets using Big Data Framework](../Literature%20Review/JACET_Volume%205_Issue%203_Page%20143-160.pdf). This paper came out of the Ilamic Azad University in Iran. The writer focuses on Iranian Olympians instead of sports. Using tweets in both English and Farsi they classify tweets as fearful, angry, surprising, sadness, joyful, neutral, and anticipation. We will be only concerned about classifying tweets as negative, positive, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most work follows the same general outline there are differences in sentiment analysis works. For instance, [2016 Olympic Games on Twitter: Sentiment Analysis of Sports Fans Tweets using Big Data Framework](../Literature%20Review/JACET_Volume%205_Issue%203_Page%20143-160.pdf) uses the WordNet package to handle most of their preprocessing and sentiment analysis model. [Geeks for Geeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/) uses the TextBlob library for their sentiment analysis. [Yalin Yener](https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-python-d6f650ade58d) introduces the Vader sentiment engine in the nltk library.\n",
    "\n",
    "After review, we have decided to pursue using mostly the Natural Language ToolKit(NLTK) and the Textblob libraries. With these libraries, we should be able to do most of the data cleaning and allows us to use the Vader sentiment engine. More information on Vader will be presented in the Model Creation section."
