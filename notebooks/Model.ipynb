    "To provide sentiment analysis for tweet data, we utilize two packages: (1) TextBlob and (2) VADER from the NLTK toolkit. TextBlob provides a simple interface for processing text-based data and allows for the calculation of the subjectivity and polarity for a given text, which will aid in sentiment analysis using a set of additional text features. The VADER model is a pre-trained model that uses rule-based values which are especially attuned to sentiments from social media, making it a great choice for overall sentiment analysis. \n"
